Here, we present a cancer early diagnosis approach using tumor fractions deciphered from circulating cfDNA methylation signatures. We show that the estimated fractions of tumor-derived cfDNA from cancer patients increase significantly as cancer progresses in two independent datasets. Employing the predicted tumor fractions, we establish a Bayesian diagnostic model in which training samples are only derived from late-stage patients and healthy individuals. When validated on early-stage patients and healthy individuals, this model exhibits a sensitivity of 86.1% for cancer early detection and an average accuracy of 76.9% for tumor localization at a specificity of 94.7%. By highlighting the potential of tumor fractions on cancer early diagnosis, our approach can be further applied to cancer screening and tumor progression monitoring.","tags":["cfDNA","DNA methylation","Bayesian model","Cancer screening","SRFD-Bayes"],"title":"Tumor fractions deciphered from circulating cell-free DNA methylation for cancer early diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinjiang Guo","Q Liu","Han Guo","Xi Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"\rCreate your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including code, math, and images.\n","date":1645401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1678580496,"objectID":"557dc08fd4b672a0c08e0a8cf0c9ff7d","permalink":"https://liuqdev.github.io/zh/publication/preprint/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/preprint/","section":"publication","summary":"Robust and efficient interpretation of QSAR methods is quite useful to validate AI prediction rationales with subjective opinion (chemist or biologist expertise), understand sophisticated chemical or biological process mechanisms, and provide heuristic ideas for structure optimization in pharmaceutical industry. For this purpose, we construct a multi-layer self-attention based Graph Neural Network framework, namely Ligandformer, for predicting compound property with interpretation. Ligandformer integrates attention maps on compound structure from different network blocks. The integrated attention map reflects the machine's local interest on compound structure, and indicates the relationship between predicted compound property and its structure. This work mainly contributes to three aspects: 1. Ligandformer directly opens the black-box of deep learning methods, providing local prediction rationales on chemical structures. 2. Ligandformer gives robust prediction in different experimental rounds, overcoming the ubiquitous prediction instability of deep learning methods. 3. Ligandformer can be generalized to predict different chemical or biological properties with high performance. Furthermore, Ligandformer can simultaneously output specific property score and visible attention map on structure, which can support researchers to investigate chemical or biological property and optimize structure efficiently. Our framework outperforms over counterparts in terms of accuracy, robustness and generalization, and can be applied in complex system study.","tags":["GNN","AIDD","QSAR","Molecular Property Predition"],"title":"Ligandformer: A Graph Neural Network for Predicting Compound Property with Robust Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["LIU QI","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
