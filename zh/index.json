Here, we present a cancer early diagnosis approach using tumor fractions deciphered from circulating cfDNA methylation signatures. We show that the estimated fractions of tumor-derived cfDNA from cancer patients increase significantly as cancer progresses in two independent datasets. Employing the predicted tumor fractions, we establish a Bayesian diagnostic model in which training samples are only derived from late-stage patients and healthy individuals. When validated on early-stage patients and healthy individuals, this model exhibits a sensitivity of 86.1% for cancer early detection and an average accuracy of 76.9% for tumor localization at a specificity of 94.7%. By highlighting the potential of tumor fractions on cancer early diagnosis, our approach can be further applied to cancer screening and tumor progression monitoring.","tags":["cfDNA","DNA methylation","Bayesian model","Cancer screening","SRFD-Bayes"],"title":"Tumor fractions deciphered from circulating cell-free DNA methylation for cancer early diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinjiang Guo","Q Liu","Han Guo","Xi Lu"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.

For this purpose, we construct a multi-layer self-attention based Graph Neural Network framework, namely Ligandformer, for predicting compound property with interpretation. Ligandformer integrates attention maps on compound structure from different network blocks. The integrated attention map reflects the machine's local interest on compound structure, and indicates the relationship between predicted compound property and its structure. This work mainly contributes to three aspects: 1. Ligandformer directly opens the black-box of deep learning methods, providing local prediction rationales on chemical structures. 2. Ligandformer gives robust prediction in different experimental rounds, overcoming the ubiquitous prediction instability of deep learning methods. 3. Ligandformer can be generalized to predict different chemical or biological properties with high performance. Furthermore, Ligandformer can simultaneously output specific property score and visible attention map on structure, which can support researchers to investigate chemical or biological property and optimize structure efficiently. Our framework outperforms over counterparts in terms of accuracy, robustness and generalization, and can be applied in complex system study.","tags":["GNN","AIDD","QSAR","Molecular Property Predition"],"title":"Ligandformer: A Graph Neural Network for Predicting Compound Property with Robust Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["刘奇","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Here, we present a cancer early diagnosis approach using tumor fractions deciphered from circulating cfDNA methylation signatures. We show that the estimated fractions of tumor-derived cfDNA from cancer patients increase significantly as cancer progresses in two independent datasets. Employing the predicted tumor fractions, we establish a Bayesian diagnostic model in which training samples are only derived from late-stage patients and healthy individuals. When validated on early-stage patients and healthy individuals, this model exhibits a sensitivity of 86.1% for cancer early detection and an average accuracy of 76.9% for tumor localization at a specificity of 94.7%. By highlighting the potential of tumor fractions on cancer early diagnosis, our approach can be further applied to cancer screening and tumor progression monitoring.","tags":["cfDNA","DNA methylation","Bayesian model","Cancer screening","SRFD-Bayes"],"title":"Tumor fractions deciphered from circulating cell-free DNA methylation for cancer early diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinjiang Guo","Q Liu","Han Guo","Xi Lu"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.

For this purpose, we construct a multi-layer self-attention based Graph Neural Network framework, namely Ligandformer, for predicting compound property with interpretation. Ligandformer integrates attention maps on compound structure from different network blocks. The integrated attention map reflects the machine's local interest on compound structure, and indicates the relationship between predicted compound property and its structure. This work mainly contributes to three aspects: 1. Ligandformer directly opens the black-box of deep learning methods, providing local prediction rationales on chemical structures. 2. Ligandformer gives robust prediction in different experimental rounds, overcoming the ubiquitous prediction instability of deep learning methods. 3. Ligandformer can be generalized to predict different chemical or biological properties with high performance. Furthermore, Ligandformer can simultaneously output specific property score and visible attention map on structure, which can support researchers to investigate chemical or biological property and optimize structure efficiently. Our framework outperforms over counterparts in terms of accuracy, robustness and generalization, and can be applied in complex system study.","tags":["GNN","AIDD","QSAR","Molecular Property Predition"],"title":"Ligandformer: A Graph Neural Network for Predicting Compound Property with Robust Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qi Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1622419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1622419200,"objectID":"10a917e73ceb9df64e758b6d8c625c4b","permalink":"https://liuqdev.github.io/zh/publication/thu_thesis/","publishdate":"2021-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/thu_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"The recognition of tumor-specific DNA methylation sites in peripheral blood is an important research direction and hotspot in the field of liquid biopsy for cancers. Facing the requirements of liquid biopsy for cancers, this thesis makes the researches on methods for identifying tumor-specific DNA methylation sites in peripheral blood. The main results of the thesis are as follows: (1). This thesis integrates DNA methylation data of multiple types of tumors and blood from some tumor-related databases such as TCGA, Xena, GEO, etc., and constructs a large-scale DNA methylation dataset that can be used for identifying tumor-specific DNA methylation sites and predicting the tissue-of-origin. (2). Considering the characteristic that the number of samples in the DNA methylation data set is much smaller than that of features, this thesis proposes a method based on category-specific filtering for identifying DNA methylation sites. Based on this method, tumor-specific DNA methylation sites for each type of tumor can be identified through differential methylation analysis between every two classes. (3). Focusing on the problem that it is hard to screen enough tumor-specific DNA methylation sites with the increase of tumor categories, this thesis proposes a measurement method based on statistical ignificance and mutual information for measuring DNA methylation sites. And supervised classification models are used to evaluate the performance of the prediction of tumor tissue-of-origin. The proposed method can use less information on tumor-specific DNA methylation sites to obtain better prediction performance of tumor tissue-of-origin. The effectiveness of the method for identifying tumor-specific DNA methylation sites in peripheral blood is validated on multiple data sets.

This paper builds several end-to-end image captioning models by combining RNN especially LSTM with several deep convolutional neural networks, and performances are compared among models. All the models are belonged to the CNN+RNN architecture. The front convolutional neural network is used to extract the feature code from the input image, which is passed as input to the RNN decoder. All the models use the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss function and are trained end-to-end. The results on several datasets show that the models can learn to make the description more accurate. The final models are able to generate natural language descriptions according to the image content. Results on the Flisk8k dataset shows that the BLEU-1 of the one model reached 0.508, and the BLEU-2 reached 0.300, which exceeded some of the existing models.
